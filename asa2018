Are baby boomers really unhappy? The cohort in which people are born plays a significant role in the outcomes of their lives, in part, because the number of people born in a particular cohort affects their wellbeing of its members (Easterlin 1987; 2004; Macunovich & Easterlin 2010). According to Easterlin (1987), a relatively large cohort tends to have more competitive job market, higher income inequality, and fewer social resources such as the housing market, the marital market, and education opportunities (Macunovich & Easterlin 2010). Consistent with Easterlin’s hypothesis, empirical studies show people from baby-boomer cohorts in the U.S. tend to worse off economically than people from other cohorts, perhaps due to their large size (Easterlin 1987; Yang 2008; Slack & Jenson 2008). Recent studies show cohort studies have mental health implication. People from large cohorts, especially people from the baby-boomer generation, tend to report the lowest average subjective wellbeing (Yang 2008; Fukuda 2013).

How many children a family plans to have is not only an important economic decision, but, fertility also has collectively socioeconomic consequences (Chaudhury 1977; Heer 1985; Wright 1989; Macunovich 2000; Macunovich & Easterlin 2010). However, few studies measure the impact of the relative cohort size on happiness; and researchers overwhelmingly focus on the age aspect of demographic effect on happiness, whereas cohort and historical aspects of the population dynamics are often ignored (Blanchflower & Oswald 2004; 2008; 2017; Powdthavee 2005; Margolis & Myrskyla 2011; Oswald & Powdthavee 2008; Fukuda 2014;). A few scholars accounted the cohort and period variance for their happiness studies, none have tested any causal mechanism that may explain cohort effects and subjective wellbeing – i.e. the cohort size (Fukuda 2013; Yang 2008; Slack & Jenson 2008; Yang 2008; Sutin et al. 2013). For example, Yang (2008) found cohorts’ happiness is significantly different from each other. However, Yang did not test what causes the cohort difference in happiness, but speculate the low average happiness among baby boomers is probably due to their large cohort size (ibid). Most cohort studies on happiness account neither for cohort characteristics (such as cohort size, fertility rate, gender ratios, births by regions), nor period characteristics (such as significant social events, financial crises, GDP).

Based on Yang’s paper (2008), we use United Kingdom data from the European Social Survey test if the cohort effect on wellbeing is unique to the U.S. Cohort studies on happiness are almost nonexistent outside the United States context. Some studies found a significant negative effect on happiness for baby boomer cohorts (Bardo et al. 2017; Fukuda 2013; Yang 2008; Slack & Jenson 2008; Easterlin 1987), but the cohort effect of baby boomers may be idiosyncratic to the historical and cultural conditions of the U.S. Therefore, replication of the study in a different context is needed to verify the baby boomer cohort effect.

The age-period-cohort model (APC) has been the predominant method in studying time-specific population based phenomena in social and medical sciences (Mason and Wolfinger 2002; Yang et al. 2008). However, a serious drawback of APC analysis is its identification problem - age, period, and birth year are perfectly correlated with each other (i.e., birth year = interview year - age) (Yang & Land 2008; Fukuda 2013). Many researchers specify birth cohorts time periods as three or five-year periods and only use statistical tools to solve the identification issue (Yang 2008; Slack & Jenson 2008; Fukuda 2013; Sutin et al. 2013; Bardo et al. 2017). These types of time specification may not fully mitigate the collinearity among age, period, and cohort. We divide the cohort groups according to culturally defined generations in addition to statistical strategies used by prior studies.

In conclusion, our contribution to cohort-wellbeing studies is threefold. We fill the gap in the knowledge on the relationship between cohort characteristics and life outcomes by measuring the cohort size directly. We are the first to apply the age-period-cohort analysis to happiness studies on the UK population. Additionally, we test different types of specification of cohorts in the Age-Period-Cohort analysis to improve APC model’s robustness and meaningfulness.
